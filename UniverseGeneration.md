# Universe Generation + Center of mass Actors

## The Universe
- The universe is going to be an oct tree or an r* tree.
- do not know anythign about r* so that will be an optomisation. 
	- Although i know spatial databases use them so would be using off the shelf.
	- This also suggests that you definatley need to think about partitioning and partial reads etc.
	- large parts of universe are nto goign to be doing anything
		- possibly as much as 99%
		- This points at generating it as and when necessary.
			- maybe ultimatley give players rules and controls over this.
- That said i havent looked into deleting nodes in an oct tree ...
- Other problem is that universe is going to be large way beyond one machines ability as will be in gigabytes.
	- ths is especially true when you get into processing everythign within.
- so **main idea** is to have a tree that has center of mass actors at its leaves.
- The **Center of Mass Manager Actor** is probably going to end up being responsible for querying against this system.

## Center Of Mass Actors
- These are solar systems
- Within these the 'sim' game will take place locally.
	- Celestial Body
		- Star
			- Each Center of Mass Actor has 0-many stars
			- stars have a composition that will have an effect on the properties of the generated planets.
				- Energy Output will effect the temperature on a planet given its orbit radius
		- Planets
			- This category covers all objects that orbit a center of mass.
			- not yet considered things like the oort belt.
				- probably going to use something like comets or just have really large 'asteroids' orbiting (so mini planets)
			- these celestial bodies will have factories.
	- Update Loop
		- Initial idea is not to have things orbiting.
			- In order to facilitate this
				- if strucures extrude from surface of body then:
					- player 'structures' need to be placed relative to a celestial body.
					- structures must have no risk of collision with other bodies structures
						- will lead to orbit no-build zones.
						- moons could be problematic in terms of sweep - but as such become inherenty harder to build on
				- if strucures are build on a 2d surface that is representative of surface area?
					- volume of planet directly related to surface area.
					- can model areas as unbuildable.
					- no worries with impingement into space.
					- seems far simpler.
					- surface area provides an interesting constraint that is intuitive.
	- trade with nearby systems is likley to be mandatory.
		- self sufficient systems are likley to be the only viable system if any exist.
			- once players realise they exist then system choce will just get rerolled until its optimal.
			- maybe each system needs a base levels to facilitate certain kinds of production.
				- does this point towards beign able to generate starter systems based on a points system?
					- starter kits?
			- self sufficiently becomes easier with construction as can provide basic self sufficiency through units that require resource to run.
