### How do I get set up? ###

* Summary of set up
vs2015, net46, everythign is nuget based except you need graphviz fro the tests that print out their trees for debug purposes.
* Configuration
	- None atm, unless you want to run anything with persistence.
	- Currently tests are hard coded with a config.
		- Refactoring this into an injected config is desirable.
	- Persistence tech specific code is currently being avoided in favour of simply coding against common abstraction.

* Dependencies
	- nuget
	- graphviz
* Database configuration
* How to run tests
* Deployment instructions
	- No consideration given yet as probably depends on azure vs aws
