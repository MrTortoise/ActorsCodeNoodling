Feature: ContainerPerFeaturePart2
	In order to share expensive configuration accross scenarios
	As a lazy dev
	I want to confirm the iterator resets to 0 and still iterates

Scenario: Take the iterator, confirm is 0 and then iterate to a value 3

Scenario: Take the iterator, confirm is 3 and then iterate to a value 6

Scenario: Take the iterator, confirm is 6 and then iterate to a value 9
