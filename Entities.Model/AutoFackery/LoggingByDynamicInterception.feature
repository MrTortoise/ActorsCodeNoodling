Feature: LoggingByDynamicInterception
	In order to inspect calls inside composite components where it is undesirable to break into smaller units
	As a lazy dev who dislikes lots of logging code for tests in live code just in case its needed
	I want to be able to decide at configuration time where and when logging happens and assert against it

Scenario: Take 4 classes that communicate and make a call through them

Scenario: Take 4 classes that communicate and make a call through them but log the communication between middle 2
